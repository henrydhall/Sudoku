# Sudoku
Experimenting with solving and generating Sudoku puzzles with Python.

## Setup and Running
* Just download/clone, and I have powershell scripts right now to run it. I suppose I could set up bash or command prompt scripts as well, but for now that's what we've got.

## TODO
* Up next: check test coverage, get coverage back up.
* Make table more readable with lines between blocks.
* Handle invalid solutions
    - Add error message.
* Make form prettier.
* Make bottom margin bigger.
* Add database
* Catch bad solutions like for .23456789....................1
